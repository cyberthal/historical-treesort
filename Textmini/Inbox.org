I'm concerned that the skill floor for FIIR - Fast Iterative Inductive Refiling - is too high. Making cascade the default would reduce ambiguity and therefore difficulty. It's impractical to adopt without an ergonomic means of renumbering Dired directories. Org already has this via org-move-item-up on a numbered list, so the code could be adapted. This should be part of Treefactor.

Once the code is added to Treefactor, I'll need to refactor Littlebook's Textmind going forward to conform to the new convention.
