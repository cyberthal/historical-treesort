Treesort moves text and files through a directory tree.

Treesort's main command is ts-throw. It moves text or files from the current window to a target in the next window. A second function, ts-throw-up, moves text or files up one directory level. You can throw directories the same as files.

When you throw a file to a directory, ts-throw creates a child directory <target-directory>/0-Inbox/ and puts the file there. This makes it easy to remember which files are new arrivals.

When you throw text to a directory, ts-throw creates a file Inbox.org. Lots of these files get created during a filing session. You can quickly delete them with ts-delete-this-buffer-and-file.

Treesort can rapidly change the directory tree structure of your notes. It helps to have some links that won't break when paths change. Use ts-dired-zinks to create a file with an org-id link in it.

ts-throw can throw text into existing files or outlines. You can duplicate a heading to another window with ts-duplicate-heading-to-other-window.

When you throw text to a file, ts-throw puts the text at the bottom. EXCEPT when the file already has a level-1 heading. Then ts-throw assumes this is a polished document, not an inbox file. ts-throw worries you will forget about text appended to polished documents. So it prepends the text before the level-1 headline, where it will stick out like a sore thumb.

ts-throw assumes that most headings you file will have four or more stars. Why? Imagine you are throwing headings to an outline. The level-1 heading is the document title. The level-2 headings are categories. The level-3 headings are subcategories. The level-4 headings are topics. Outlines become unwieldy when they get too deep, at which point it's better to create more files and directories to spread the load. 

ts-throw only imposes this opinion on you in one way: it creates Inbox.org files with a "**** offset" at the top. You can still file level-5 headings, but they might "vanish" if you accidentally file a level-4 heading that folds appended level-5 headings beneath it. You can also file level-3 headings, although they won't be children of the "offset" heading, and might unexpectedly subsume level-4 headings. I recommend that you convert headings to level 4 for transport, and then resize them at their destination.

The last text kill is saved in the variable ts-object-text until the Emacs session ends.
