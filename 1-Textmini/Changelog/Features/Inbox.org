**** Treefactor | removed zinks | need to propagate change to docs, after release

ok, I can see how zinks would be kind of useful...
[2021-02-24 Wed 17:02]

but no, zinks violates the Treefactor philosophy
it creates invisibly-breakable associations between path and heading

connections should be natural language, and navigation should be manual
if that isn't sufficient, then brain-sync needs improvement via refactoring
if info is buried too deep, or takes too long to find, then it should be surfaced

zinks sounds useful, superficially, but is worthless in practice.

just delete it.  or at minimum, comment it out.

yep, removed it.

Removing zinks feature from Treefactor.  I never use it, and it's contrary to the philosophy.  And bugged outside Spacemacs.
