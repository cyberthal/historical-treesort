**** treefactor | functions | interactive | namespace | collisions | "heading" | don't fix

***** collisions

Should I rename treefactor-org-refactor-heading and treefactor-org-duplicate-heading-to-other-window
so that leo-headingfy won't get collisions in M-x?

***** status quo | benefits

descriptive function names are good. and it would be extra work.

***** helm machine learning fixes collisions

does helm learn what I want? try restarting to see.

restarted emacs.
yes, it appears helm does learn. headingfy ranked first for M-x head

***** no change needed

good enough.

canceling task.

even if there's some initial friction from M-x errors, headingfy is much less cognitively intense than refactor, and thus the friction isn't important enough to justify the required effort and resulting confusion.
