**** Treefactor | testing | tools to use | ecukes and buttercup

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing

sounds like I need both unit testing and integration testing
integration is probably more important, given I care about results
and that requires the interoperation of dired and org with treefactor.

so I'm using ecukes certainly, and probably also buttercup
