**** apply ERT TDD to Treefactor first, then other tools

ERT manual:  6.2 Fixtures and Test Suites
argues that additional tools for fixtures and test suites are superfluous in elisp.

I can decide after evaluating ecukes and buttercup.

I should probably do what I can with vanilla ERT first, then add el-mock, then add the next layer.

**** I read Emacs ERT manual, and took notes for Treefactor TDD

I can try reading this.  It might be too advanced, in which case I should learn debugging first.

Should I be learning this or is it obsolete?
I suspect it's fundamental, not obsolete.  Continue.

Ah good, elisp-koans did teach me quite a bit about using ERT, although I didn't realize it at the time.
